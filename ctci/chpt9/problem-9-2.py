# For a social network (FB or LinkedIn) you'd 
# assume a graph like DB would apt w/ a limit on
# how many connections any one person could have
# say 5000. It would be slightly lopsided for read
# over write but not as dramatically as something
# like Youtube or Twitter.

# Shortest path would be a travelling salesman like
# algorithm such as Dijkstra's.
