# Blue eyed island

# There is an island full of N people where someone comes
# along and says all blue eyed people must leave the island.
# There is a boat that transports people off every evening
# at 8 pm. Everyone can see each others eye colour but not
# their own. Critically, IN NO WAY can they communicate what
# someone else's eyecolour is to them. This includes saying
# 'you should leave' or 'You don't have brown, green, red,
# etc... eye colour (thus you must have...)'. The question 
# doesn't specify this. 

# How many days will it take for all the blue eyed people
# to leave the island if atleast one person on the island
# has blue eyes?

# The answer here is that on the first day if you only see
# say brown coloured eyes and not any blue then you must
# be the one who has blue eyes so you leave.

# If no on leave on the first day and you see one other 
# person with blue eyes you know it must be you both have
# blue eyes so two (including you) will leave on the second
# night.

# On the third night if no one has left but you see two 
# others have blue eyes then it must be you three only so
# you leave on the third night.

# Hence.... for B people with blue eyes out of N will take
# B nights to figure out.
